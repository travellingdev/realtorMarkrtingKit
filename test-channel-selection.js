===========================================
CHANNEL SELECTION BUG FIX - TEST PLAN
===========================================

This test verifies that the channel selection bug is fixed.
Previously, all channels generated content regardless of selection.
After the fix, only selected channels should generate content.

===========================================
TEST CASES:
===========================================
`);

testCases.forEach((test, index) => {
  console.log(`${index + 1}. ${test.name}`);
  console.log(`   Channels: [${test.channels.join(', ')}]`);
  console.log(`   Expected results:`);
  Object.entries(test.expected).forEach(([field, expectation]) => {
    console.log(`     - ${field}: ${expectation}`);

===========================================
MANUAL TESTING STEPS:
===========================================

1. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

2. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser

3. Fill in basic property details:
   - Address: 123 Test St
   - Beds: 3
   - Baths: 2
   - Sqft: 2000
   - Neighborhood: Test Area
   - Features: Pool, Garden

4. For each test case above:
   a. Clear all channel selections (uncheck all boxes)
   b. Select only the channels specified in the test case
   c. Click "Generate My First Kit"
   d. Check browser console for: "[pipeline] Channel filtering applied"
   e. Verify the log shows correct channel selection
   f. Check the outputs:
      - Selected channels should have content
      - Unselected channels should be empty
   
5. Check console logs for:
   - "[pipeline] Channel filtering applied" with correct selection
   - Verify hasMLSContent, hasIGContent, hasReelContent, hasEmailContent match selection

===========================================
EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT:
===========================================

For "Only MLS selected" test:
[pipeline] Channel filtering applied {
  selected: ['mls'],
  hasMLSContent: true,
  hasIGContent: false,
  hasReelContent: false,
  hasEmailContent: false
}

===========================================
VERIFICATION:
===========================================

✅ PASS if:
- Only selected channels generate content
- Unselected channels return empty values
- Console logs show correct filtering

❌ FAIL if:
- Unselected channels still have content
- All channels generate regardless of selection
- No filtering logs appear

===========================================
DEBUGGING:
===========================================

If tests fail, check:
1. useRealtorKit.ts - channels state initialization
2. pipeline.ts - channelInstructions generation
3. pipeline.ts - channel filtering before return
4. ChannelSelector.tsx - UI selection logic

Look for these log messages:
- composeDraftMessages should show channel instructions
- generateKit should show channel filtering
