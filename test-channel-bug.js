/**
 * Test for Channel Selection Bug - User with exhausted free kits

 * ISSUE: Even when UI shows channels as locked (user has used 2/2 free kits),
 * the API is still generating content for all channels.
 * 
 * EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
 * - User with exhausted free kits (quotaUsed >= limit)
 * - Should only get MLS and Email content
 * - Instagram and Reel should be empty
 * 
 * ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
 * - All channels are generating content

CHANNEL BUG INVESTIGATION
===========================================

TEST SCENARIO:
- User has used 2/2 free kits (quota exhausted)
- User is on FREE tier
- User selects Instagram and Reel in UI (which show as locked)
- Generate content

===========================================
WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE:
===========================================

1. API Route Logs:
   Look for: "[api/generate] DEBUG: Incoming request"
   - Should show incomingChannels from UI
   
2. Check Filtering Logic:
   Look for: "[api/generate] DEBUG: Channel filtering logic"
   - freeKitsRemaining should be FALSE
   - Should trigger filtering
   
3. Forced Channel Override:
   Look for: "[api/generate] FILTERING: User exhausted free kits"
   - Should show channels being forced to ['mls', 'email']
   
4. Pipeline Reception:
   Look for: "[pipeline] DEBUG: generateKit called"
   - channelsReceived should be ['mls', 'email'] (NOT all channels)
   
5. Final Filtering:
   Look for: "[pipeline] Channel filtering applied"
   - Should show only MLS and Email with content
   - Instagram and Reel should be empty

===========================================
TEST STEPS:
===========================================

1. Use a test account that has quotaUsed = 2, limit = 2
2. Go to /v3 or main page
3. Fill in property details
4. Select all channels (even locked ones)
5. Click Generate
6. Check console output

===========================================
POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CHECK:
===========================================

1. Is quotaUsed being read correctly from profile?
2. Is freeKitsRemaining calculation correct?
3. Is tierAwareControls.channels being overwritten?
4. Is the filtering happening BEFORE or AFTER generation?
5. Is there a cache issue returning old content?
