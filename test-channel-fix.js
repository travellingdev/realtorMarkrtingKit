CHANNEL SELECTION BUG FIX - VERIFICATION
===========================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- API route was overriding channel selection for FREE tier users
- Even during free trial, channels were forced to ['mls', 'email']
- This prevented Instagram and Reel content generation

FIX APPLIED:
- API now checks if user has free kits remaining
- During free trial: All selected channels are respected
- After free trial: Channels filtered based on tier

===========================================
TEST PROCEDURE:
===========================================

1. Server should be running (npm run dev)

2. Test with FREE tier user (with free kits):
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Fill in property details:
     * Address: 123 Test St
     * Beds: 3
     * Baths: 2
     * Sqft: 2000
     * Neighborhood: Test Area
   
3. Select channels:
   ✅ MLS Description
   ✅ Instagram
   ✅ Reels/TikTok
   ✅ Email
   
4. Generate content

5. Check console output for:
   "[api/generate] All platforms available during free trial"
   - Should show selectedChannels: ['mls', 'instagram', 'reel', 'email']
   
6. Verify channel filtering log:
   "[pipeline] Channel filtering applied"
   - Should show:
     * hasMLSContent: true
     * hasIGContent: true
     * hasReelContent: true
     * hasEmailContent: true

===========================================
EXPECTED CONSOLE OUTPUT:
===========================================

BEFORE FIX (WRONG):
[api/generate] Platform filtering for tier { userId: '...', tier: 'FREE' }
[pipeline] Channel filtering applied {
  selected: [ 'mls', 'email' ],  // ❌ Instagram and Reel missing!
  hasMLSContent: true,
  hasIGContent: false,            // ❌ Should be true
  hasReelContent: false,           // ❌ Should be true
  hasEmailContent: true
}

AFTER FIX (CORRECT):
[api/generate] All platforms available during free trial {
  userId: '...',
  tier: 'FREE',
  freeKitsRemaining: 2,
  selectedChannels: ['mls', 'instagram', 'reel', 'email']
}
[pipeline] Channel filtering applied {
  selected: ['mls', 'instagram', 'reel', 'email'],  // ✅ All selected channels
  hasMLSContent: true,
  hasIGContent: true,              // ✅ Instagram content generated
  hasReelContent: true,             // ✅ Reel content generated
  hasEmailContent: true
}

===========================================
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
===========================================

✅ Instagram slides should be generated (4-5 slides)
✅ Reel script should be generated (30-60 second script)
✅ MLS description should be generated
✅ Email subject and body should be generated
✅ No channels should be filtered out during free trial
✅ Console shows "All platforms available during free trial"

===========================================
IF TEST FAILS:
===========================================

1. Check quotaUsed vs limit:
   - User should have quotaUsed < limit for free trial

2. Verify controls.channels is passed correctly:
   - Should contain all selected channels from UI

3. Check pipeline.ts channel filtering:
   - Should not filter out channels when passed in controls

===========================================
