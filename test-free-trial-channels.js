   - Sign up for new account
   - Go to generator page

   - Generate content
   - Verify all channels generate content
   - Check console for "[pipeline] Channel filtering applied"

4. Test SECOND KIT:
   - Generate another kit
   - Verify "All channels available (1 free kit left)"
   - All channels should still work

5. Test AFTER FREE KITS:
   - Generate a third kit (should fail)

CONSOLE LOGS TO CHECK:
===========================================

Look for these messages:

1. When generating with selected channels:
[pipeline] Channel filtering applied {
  selected: ['mls', 'instagram', 'reel', 'email'],
  hasMLSContent: true,
  hasIGContent: true,
  hasReelContent: true,
  hasEmailContent: true
}

2. Channel instructions in prompt:
"Generate ONLY these outputs: mlsDesc, igSlides, reelScript, emailSubject, emailBody"

===========================================
DATABASE VERIFICATION:
===========================================

Check profiles table:
- quota_used: increments with each generation
- quota_extra: additional free kits if unlocked
- plan: user tier (FREE, STARTER, PROFESSIONAL, etc.)

===========================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA:

‚úÖ Free users can access all channels during free kits
‚úÖ Visual indicators clearly show trial status
‚úÖ Smooth transition from trial to tier restrictions
‚úÖ No confusion about what's available
‚úÖ Clear messaging about remaining free kits

===========================================
EDGE CASES:
===========================================

1. User with extra unlocked kits (survey completion)
   - Should extend free trial access

2. User upgrades during free trial
   - Should maintain access based on new tier
   - "FREE TRIAL" badges should disappear

3. User downgrades after paid
   - Should respect current tier restrictions
   - No free trial access unless quota allows
