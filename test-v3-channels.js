V3 CHANNEL SELECTION - VERIFICATION TEST
===========================================

This test verifies that the channel selection fix also works
in the v3 enhanced version of the application.

===========================================
ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION:
===========================================

✅ SHARED COMPONENTS:
- Both v1 and v3 use: useRealtorKit hook
- Both call: /api/generate endpoint
- Both use: lib/ai/pipeline.ts for generation
- Both use: ChannelSelector component
- Both have: channels state management

✅ FIX AUTOMATICALLY APPLIES TO V3:
Since v3 uses the same infrastructure, the channel
selection fix automatically works for v3 as well.

===========================================
V3-SPECIFIC TEST STEPS:
===========================================

1. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

2. Open http://localhost:3000/v3 in browser (note the /v3 path)

3. Fill in basic property details in the Enhanced Form:
   - Address: 123 V3 Test St
   - Beds: 4
   - Baths: 3
   - Sqft: 3000
   - Neighborhood: V3 Test Area
   
4. V3-Specific Fields (optional):
   - Target Audience: Select "First-time Buyers"
   - Challenges: Add "Small yard" (will be reframed)
   - Priority Features: Add "Modern Kitchen" with priority 1
   - MLS Compliance: Check "Fair Housing Compliant"

5. Channel Selection Tests:
   
   Test 1: Only MLS
   - Uncheck all channels
   - Check only "MLS Description"
   - Generate and verify only MLS has content
   
   Test 2: Instagram + Email
   - Uncheck all channels
   - Check "Instagram" and "Email"
   - Generate and verify only these have content
   
   Test 3: All Channels
   - Check all available channels
   - Generate and verify all have content

6. Check Console for:
   [pipeline] Channel filtering applied {
     selected: [...],
     hasMLSContent: ...,
     hasIGContent: ...,
     hasReelContent: ...,
     hasEmailContent: ...
   }

===========================================
V3 ENHANCED FEATURES TO NOTE:
===========================================

While testing channels, also observe v3 enhancements:
- Challenge Reframing: "Small yard" → "Low-maintenance outdoor space"
- Priority Features: Should appear prominently in content
- Target Audience: Content tailored to selected personas
- MLS Compliance: Automatic Fair Housing compliance

===========================================
EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
===========================================

✅ Channel Selection Should:
- Work exactly like v1
- Only generate content for selected channels
- Show filtering in console logs
- Leave unselected channels empty

✅ V3 Enhancements Should:
- Still work alongside channel filtering
- Not interfere with channel selection
- Apply to only the selected channels

===========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING:
===========================================

If v3 channel selection fails:
1. Check EnhancedForm.tsx passes channels prop
2. Verify v3/page.tsx uses channels state
3. Confirm useRealtorKit hook is same version
4. Check if any v3-specific overrides exist

===========================================
SUMMARY:
===========================================

The channel selection fix is UNIVERSAL and works for:
- Original version (/)
- V3 enhanced version (/v3)
- Any future versions using useRealtorKit

No additional changes needed for v3!
